            <h2>1. The Power of Visual Storytelling</h2>
            <p>Visual arts, such as paintings and digital illustrations, can convey biblical truths and themes in powerful ways. By engaging with visuals, believers can gain fresh perspectives on scripture and deepen their understanding of God’s Word. Churches and faith communities have long used stained glass windows, murals, and contemporary designs to inspire worship and contemplation.</p>

            <h2>2. Music: The Universal Language of Worship</h2>
            <p>Music holds a special place in worship. Whether through hymns, contemporary Gospel songs, or instrumental meditations, music has the unique ability to stir emotions and lift hearts toward heaven. The Bible frequently highlights the importance of music in praising God, such as in Psalms where David encourages all creation to sing praises to the Lord.</p>

            <h2>3. Dance as an Expression of Joy and Praise</h2>
            <p>Dance is another powerful form of creative expression that honors God. King David himself danced with joy before the Lord (2 Samuel 6:14). In many cultures, dance is used to express gratitude, celebration, and reverence. Incorporating dance into worship can bring joy and a sense of liberation in God’s presence.</p>
